Objective: To develop a flight prediction model that forecasts flight prices based on various factors, providing users with real-time price predictions.

## Factors Analyzed:
Airline: Different airlines may have varying pricing strategies and fare structures.
Source: The departure airport or city, which can influence flight prices based on demand and competition.
Destination: The arrival airport or city, affecting pricing due to distance and popularity.
Number of Stops: Direct flights versus flights with layovers can significantly impact ticket prices.
Model Development
## Algorithm Used:
Random Forest:
Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with multiple features.
Provides improved accuracy through ensemble learning by combining predictions from multiple decision trees.
## Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
## Model Training
Training Process:
Trained the Random Forest model on the training dataset.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluated model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
## Integration into Flask Application
Flask Framework:
Developed a web application using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for interaction with the model.
Model Serialization:
Used Pickle to serialize the trained Random Forest model, allowing it to be saved and loaded easily within the Flask application.
## User Interaction
Real-Time Price Prediction:
Implemented input forms in the Flask application where users can enter flight details (airline, source, destination, number of stops).
Upon submission, the application processes the input, retrieves the model, and generates a price prediction based on the provided factors.
## Deployment
Deployment Considerations:
Ensured the application is accessible via a web server, allowing users to interact with the model from any device with internet access.
Considered security measures and performance optimizations for a smooth user experience.
## Conclusion
Outcome: Successfully developed and deployed a flight prediction model that provides users with real-time price predictions based on various influential factors, enhancing their ability to make informed travel decisions.
